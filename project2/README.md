# Project 2: Extensions

## Assignment

- Choose a topic related to causal inference–that we do not cover in class.
- Write a summary/tutorial (think: wiki or blog) of the topic that includes (a) the math behind the approach and (b) an empirical example.
- Present a five-minute summary of the topics to your classmates.

**Due:** All material (including slides) is due June 2, 2024. Presentations will be during lab on June 7, 2024.

## Why?

In the course of the PhD, we want to teach you how to learn. We will not provide you with everything you need to know to be able to do research on any topic. But hopefully we provide you with a foundation and the ability to learn new things. Also: You need to learn how to communicate both in writing and in person. 

## Ideas for topics

Here are a few ideas for topics to get you started. You can certainly go beyond this list.

**Identification**

- Fixed and random effects estimators
- Double differences (or triple!)
- Synthetic control methods
- Synthetic difference in differences
- Any topic from the two-way fixed effects (TWFE) literature
- Interrupted time-series
- Event studies
- Mixed models
- A deeper dive into maximium likelihood estimators
- Alternatives to IV/2SLS (LIML, split-sample, ...)
- Other forms of regression
  - Quantile regression
  - Non-parametric
- Dynamics and spillovers
- ML-assisted heterogeneous effects

**Inference**

- Wild clustered bootstrap
- Spatially clustered standard errors
