# Project Proposal, Step 1

Research question (causal relationship of interest) and motivation

*Assignment:* Pitch a project that includes a causal question of interest. Include motivation.

- This project should be something you could turn into a legitimate research project.
- Length: 150â€“250 [words](https://grammarly.com)
- You should have several drafts (only submit the last one).
- Talk with your classmates (and me!).

Think of this first step as the abstract of the paper---without the results/methods. Clearly describe the main question and why/for whom the question matters. Be concise and clear.

Read a few abstracts before writing your abstract.
