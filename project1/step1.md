*Due:* 01 May, 2024; submit on [Canvas](https://canvas.uoregon.edu/courses/239501/assignments/1655173)

- This project should be something you could turn into a legitimate research project.
- Length: 150–250 [words](https://grammarly.com)
- You should have several drafts (only submit the last one).
- Talk with your classmates (and me!).

Think of this first step as the abstract of the paper—without the results/methods. Clearly describe the main question and why/for whom the question matters. Be concise and clear.

Read a few abstracts before writing your abstract.
